description: The first website done by CDA. It was a simple social media website for a young entrenuer who wanted a place where people of big groups can plan their events and trips. The Groupbucket has the capabilities of assigning tasks for your trip or event to your peers. It also has a global feed in which members can share their experiences and pictures of their events for other people to see and have an idea of where they would want to go next. Website is currently offline due to the request of the founder, this website will be entering a phase II for redevelopment within the next year.
